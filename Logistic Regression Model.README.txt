Logistic Regression Model for Customer Purchase Prediction

Overview:

This project is a logistic regression model designed to predict whether a customer will buy a product based on their age and salary. The model achieves an accuracy of approximately 80%.

Dataset:

The dataset used for training and testing is sales_dataset.csv. It consists of customer data with features representing:

Age

Salary

Purchase Decision (1 for purchase, 0 for no purchase)

Requirements:

To run this project, you need the following dependencies installed:

Python 3.x

Pandas

NumPy

Scikit-learn

You can install them using:

pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn

How to Run:

Ensure that sales_dataset.csv is in the same directory as the script.

Enter the new customer details (age and salary) when prompted.

The script will predict whether the customer will buy the product or not.

Model Workflow

Load the dataset.

Preprocess data (feature scaling and train-test split).

Train a logistic regression model.

Predict customer purchase decisions.

Evaluate the model accuracy using accuracy_score from Scikit-learn.

Accuracy:

The model is evaluated using test data and achieves an accuracy of approximately 80%.

Future Improvements:

Add more features to improve prediction accuracy.

Implement hyperparameter tuning for better model performance.

Use a graphical interface (GUI) for better user interaction.
